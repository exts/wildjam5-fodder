# Incomplete

- Open `Data/Levels/Level1.tscn` in godot 3.1 editor to see an example of a level I had planned
- Idea was thumb precision, joystick was the 'one control' (theme) and you had to get through the level to beat it
- idea was to have like 10 levels or something and get shown some of the other scenes that I left unfinished.
- fuck it, done with interactive collision tilemaps in godot.
    - Gave up because of line 99 in `Core/Scripts/Player.cs` not working as intended when you instanced the level in another scene.
